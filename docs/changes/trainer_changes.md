# Trainer Changes

## General Changes and Information


Trainer rosters in every area have been modified. Important trainers have their roster listed below including species, levels, items, moves.
Indeed, trainers have been made more difficult across the board, compared to the base game. Compared to Vanilla Black and White 2, you will see a much greater variety in team composition, as is standard in these projects.

Pokémon Black and White 2 both have inbuilt difficulty modes, which Redux takes full advantage of.

 - Easy mode and Normal Mode both share Trainer teams. Where applicable, trainers have a unique Challenge Mode team.
 - Easy mode differs from Normal mode only by subtracting levels, equal to what they are raised by in Challenge mode. This is also noted.

Compared to the other modes, Challenge Mode increases the levels of trainers and important trainers have separate, Challenge Mode only teams.

 - Where a trainer shares a team between all three difficulty modes, this increase in levels is separately noted.
 - Where a trainer on Challenge mode has a unique team, the trainer's levels are as stated.
 - For example, you'll need to subtract 1 level from Cheren's Normal mode team if you're playing on Easy mode, but if you're playing on Challenge mode, the levels are as stated.

It is currently impossible to set Trainer Pokémon's Natures and EVs in Gen V.

 - This also the case by default in all games, up until Gen VII, however in Gen III, very talented people have managed to implement trainer EVs into their games.
 - This hasn't been cracked yet for Gen V, so all Trainer Pokémon have random Nature's and no EV's.
 - Stronger Trainers have their Pokémon's IV's set to 30/31 across the board, however.

A '*' denotes a 'Complete' version of Redux only ability. To determine the 'Classic' equivalent, match the 'Classic' version ability slot in the "Pokémon Changes" document.

Please note that this document may not always be correct. Feel free to report any incorrect information!

This document has been broken down into trainer categories for convenience. However, the best way to navigate this document is likely to search for specific trainers [Control-F, Find in page etc.].

## EV and Level Trainers' Information


Like in Renegade Platinum, Redux features a handy EV and Level Trainer (Split into two NPCs this time!). They are both found together in the PWT.

Here's a quick list of requirements to unlock the different training levels:

 - These are based on the Challenge mode level curve, but hold for all difficulties.
 - That is, the following information is correct regardless of the difficulty played on.

| Training Level | Requirement |
|:---------------|:------------|
| Lv. 10 | 1st badge |
| Lv. 20 | 2nd badge |
| Lv. 30 | 4th badge |
| Lv. 40 | 5th badge |
| Lv. 50 | 6th badge |
| Lv. 60 | 7th badge |
| Lv. 70 | 8th badge |
| Lv. 80 | Start the Postgame |
| Lv. 90 | Complete the Postgame Looker Questline |

## Level Cap and Guide (Spoiler Free!)


Many players enjoy sticking to the 'level caps' of important trainers. Below is information on the Redux level curves.
You are of course free to ignore this though, if it's not your thing :).

It is currently impossible to achieve inbuilt level caps in Gen V projects, like those seen in Radical Red et al.

 - These are born of the pokeemerald-expansion and the Complete FireRed Upgrade available for Gen III titles, no such equivalent exists yet for Gen V.
 - Thus, the player will need to manually ensure they don't over-level, if such a player decides they want to play with level caps.

Now that the game has been out a little while, these caps include caps for all boss trainers and new important battles in Redux.

 - These are the recommended caps for playing challenge runs, but you are of course free to play as you see fit :).

Here is a spoiler free level guide for Normal Mode:

 - Cheren, Lv. 13
 - Roxie, Lv. 20
 - Burgh, Lv. 27
 - Elesa, Lv. 36
 - Clay, Lv. 43
 - Skyla, Lv. 52
 - Drayden, Lv. 60
 - Marlon, Lv. 64
 - Ghetsis, Lv. 68
 - Elite Four et al, Lv. 74
 - Iris, Lv. 75

And here is a spoiler free, more comprehensive level guide for Challenge Mode:

 - Cheren, Lv. 14
 - Roxie, Lv. 21
 - New to Redux, Lv. 23
 - Burgh, Lv. 29
 - New to Redux, Lv. 33
 - Subway Masters, Lv. 36
 - Elesa, Lv. 38
 - Charles, Lv. 39
 - Rood, Lv. 41
 - Clay, Lv. 45
 - New to Redux, Lv. 53
 - Skyla, Lv. 55
 - New to Redux, Lv. 56
 - Hugh, Lv. 58
 - New to Redux, Lv. 62
 - Drayden, Lv. 64

## Challenge Mode Level Bug - Important info for Challenge Runs!


There exists a bug in all copies of Black 2 and White 2 (vanilla or modified!), for which the level shown for each trainer's Pokémon is not the real one, stat-wise.

 - This effects Easy and Challenge mode, but not Normal mode and is a Gamefreak bug in the damage calculation which currently can't ben fixed in Redux, just worked around sometimes.

For instance, Cheren's Challenge mode Munchlax is level 14. However, it actually has the stats of a level 13 Munchlax!

 - The root of the issue is that the game doesn't properly add the extra difficulty levels (these levels "Levels -1 on Easy mode, +1 on Challenge mode." etc).

Another common examples of the bug looks like this:

 - Challenging Ghetsis at the E4 level cap effectively puts the player 10 levels above his Pokémon! (+6 from overleveling, +4 from the bug)

The damage formula takes into account the level to calculate the outgoing damage of a Pokémon. For this reason, two Pokémon with identical stats but different levels will do different damage by using the same move.

 - For example: an imaginary level 50 Rattata with 100 base attack will do less damage than a level 60 rattata with 100 attack, by using the same move.
 - For this reason if you wanna level cap by using the "unbugged level", it would be better to use a level in between the bugged one and the unbugged one (otherwise you'll play in disadvantage because you'll take more damage than you're supposed to).

Generally, the bug will behave something like this:

 - The player has a +1 level advantage up until Roxie.
 - The player has a +2 level advantage up until Elesa.
 - The player has a +3 level advantage up until Skyla.
 - The player has a +4 level advantage for the rest of the game past Skyla.

This is flipped in Easy mode to a level disadvantage, which ironically makes Easy mode tougher to complete than Normal mode!

All instances in this document where you see the line "No level shift based on difficulty, levels are as stated.", the trainers in that area do not suffer from the Challenge mode level bug.

That might seem pretty confusing - and it is! How this got past Gamefreak developers is beyond me, although in a casual setting you probably won't notice the difference.

 - There are community guides you can seek out to find 'unbugged' level guides, if you want to try to minimise the advantage the bug gives the player as much as possible

To recap, if you've ever felt that Black 2 and White 2 get easier as the game progresses, this is why!

### Route 20

### Liberty Garden

 - No level shift based on difficulty, levels are as stated.
 - Victini's Guardian will only battle the player on Challenge mode, before Burgh is defeated.
 - If he is not fought before Burgh, after you have defeated Burgh he will not let you pass into the Lighthouse!
   - He will disappear in the Postgame after the player travels to Striaton City, so Victini can be later accessed (this is also true of the other two difficulties, if he hasn't already been interacted with).


**Victini Guardian**

**Battle Type:** 2x

#### Weather Trainers and Lance

After advancing through Victory Road, the player will encounter Lance - Champion of the Kanto and Johto regions - training a small group of trainers.

 - Players on Easy Mode can choose if they want to fight the first two trainers. The rest of the trainers and Lance will not fight the player.
 - Players on Normal Mode will battle the first two trainers. They can then choose to battle the other two trainers. Again, Lance will not fight the player.
 - Players on Challenge Mode will battle all four trainers and Lance. However, the player will do so in a gauntlet.
    - The Hail and Sun trainers are fought back-to-back. The player is healed between battles. Then the Rain and Sand trainers are fought back-to-back. The player is healed between battles. Finally, Lance can be fought.
	- Prepare for a brutal challenge which will push you to your absolute limits, against all Gen V weather has to throw at you!

Upon witnessing the initial cutscene, the difficulty of the gauntlet is set. Thus, you should pick your difficulty before you get here!

 - You cannot change this later!

\*Mandatory nature of these fights depends on your chosen difficulty.

 - Levels -4 on Easy mode, +4 on Challenge mode.

## The Postgame


The Postgame is still broadly undocumented as of v1.2.0, since we've not got a fantastic amount of time to spend on it!
For now, the old documentation for the postgame is presented.
If anyone in the community would like to document things and spend their own time on it, we'd be happy to integrate the documentation into these official ones.

### PWT - Postgame

Both Steven and Wallace each use six Pokémon each, for a total of twelve Pokémon. Prepare for a brutal endgame fight!
This fight has not yet been updated as of v1.2.0.
