## :material-information: Effect

!!! info "Description"

    Uses the last move targeted at the user by a Pokémon still on the field. A move counts as targeting the user even if it hit multiple Pokémon, as long as the user was one of them; however, moves targeting the field itself do not count. If the user has not been targeted by an appropriate move since entering the field, or if no Pokémon that targeted the user remains on the field, this move will fail. Moves that failed, missed, had no effect, or were blocked are still copied. Assist moves, time-delayed moves, “meta” moves that operate on other moves/Pokémon/abilities, and some other special moves cannot be copied and are ignored; if the last move to hit the user was such a move, the previous move will be used instead. The full list of ignored moves is: acid armor, acupressure, after you, agility, ally switch, amnesia, aqua ring, aromatherapy, aromatic mist, assist, autotomize, barrier, baton pass, belch, belly drum, bide, bulk up, calm mind, camouflage, celebrate, charge, coil, conversion, conversion 2, copycat, cosmic power, cotton guard, counter, crafty shield, curse, defend order, defense curl, destiny bond, detect, doom desire, double team, dragon dance, electric terrain, endure, final gambit, flower shield, focus energy, focus punch, follow me, future sight, geomancy, grassy terrain, gravity, growth, grudge, guard split, hail, happy hour, harden, haze, heal bell, heal order, heal pulse, healing wish, helping hand, hold hands, hone claws, howl, imprison, ingrain, ion deluge, iron defense, kings shield, light screen, lucky chant, lunar dance, magic coat, magnet rise, magnetic flux, mat block, me first, meditate, metronome, milk drink, mimic, minimize, mirror coat, mirror move, mist, misty terrain, moonlight, morning sun, mud sport, nasty plot, nature power, perish song, power split, power trick, protect, psych up, quick guard, quiver dance, rage powder, rain dance, recover, recycle, reflect, reflect type, refresh, rest, rock polish, role play, roost, rototiller, safeguard, sandstorm, shadow blast, shadow bolt, shadow half, shadow rush, shadow shed, shadow sky, shadow storm, shadow wave, sharpen, shell smash, shift gear, sketch, slack off, sleep talk, snatch, soft boiled, spikes, spiky shield, spit up, splash, stealth rock, sticky web, stockpile, struggle, substitute, sunny day, swallow, swords dance, synthesis, tail glow, tailwind, teleport, toxic spikes, transform, water sport, wide guard, wish, withdraw and work up.
