=============================================================
General Information
=============================================================

Legendary Encounters have been totally overhauled for Redux.

 - This is made possible by models for most all the Legendaries existing within the game files.
 - Advancements in Gen V scripting have also made several of these encounters possible.

However, for technical reasons*, each new legendary encounter can only be accessed once. Make sure to save your game before challenging them!

 - Indeed, certain 'transformation' items like the Gracadia and Reveal Glass don't work. This is due to further technical restrictions**.

Make sure you speak to the Key Gift Guy in Aspertia City, else several of these encounters will break.

You can either travel Unova and find all the legendaries for yourself, or follow the steps in this guide.

 - Catching all the Legendaries will add several hours of additional content to the postgame. Most the legendaries are encountered in the postgame, with a few exceptions.
 - The Looker quest-line in particular will add several hours of story content alone, depending on how much of the postgame has been explored when you start it.
 - *Major* Spoilers Ahead!

*For the curious reader, the limitation specifically is that for Gen V, there are far fewer Flags known to be free than in Gen III and Gen IV. Thus, to save flags, each new legendary only uses one Flag, as a conservative measure. Thus, rebattling the legendaries is not possible at this time.

**This is due to Gen V Engine Limitations. Specifically, the game checks if the Pokémon is a 'Fateful Encounter' or if it's from the Dreamworld when using the item. There is currently no way to bypass this, nor to add these attributes to Pokémon in scripts. Thus, the items are unusable for now.

=============================================================
