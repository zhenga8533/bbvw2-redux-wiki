=========================================================
General Notes
=========================================================

In Dray's original projects, the trades with NPC's you can find scattered around Unova are all broken. This has been overhauled and rectified in Redux.

 - Details of the new trades are found below.
 - The Curtis/Yancy trades remain unchanged as in BB2 and VW2.
